        <h2>About Munira</h2>
         <p>With a BSc in Biology, I had briefly worked for a healthcare industry startup, whose mission was to create an AI medical provider founded on their data collection. Working there made me realize technology today is advancing at an unsurpassed speed. To stay relevant in the future of the workforce, knowledge in computer science is highly crucial.</p>
          <p>I am excited to begin my career with Thinkful as a software developer to help address business problems through technical solutions. I am looking forward to working with other developers to achieve collective goals.</p>
          <p>Apart from exploring the wonders of web development, I enjoy venturing out in our community's public parks and like to appreciate the subtle uniqueness in seemingly ordinary surroundings.</p>
